Prep
```{r}
library(dplyr)
df <- mtcars
head(df)
```

Return rows of cars that have an mpg value greater than 20 and 6 cylinders.
```{r}
filter(df,mpg>20 & cyl==6)
```

Reorder the Data Frame by cyl first, then by descending wt.
```{r}
head(arrange(df,cyl,desc(wt)))
```

Select the columns mpg and hp
```{r}
head(select(df,mpg,hp))
```

Select the distinct values of the gear column.
```{r}
distinct(select(df,gear))
```

Create a new column called "Performance" which is calculated by hp divided by wt.
```{r}
head(mutate(df, Performance = hp/wt))
```

Find the mean mpg value using dplyr.
```{r}
summarise(df,avg_mpg=mean(mpg, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Use pipe operators to get the mean hp value for cars with 6 cylinders.
```{r}
df %>% filter(cyl==6) %>% summarise(avg_hp=mean(hp, na.rm = TRUE))
```
