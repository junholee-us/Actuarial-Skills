##### Introduction

Explore which states have the most earthquakes from the last 30 days. This may affect different home insurance premium by states or cities.

##### Key Field Description
* time: Time when the event occurred. Times are reported in milliseconds since the epoch ( 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z), and do not include leap seconds. In certain output formats, the date is formatted for readability.

* type: Type of seismic event.

* mag: The magnitude for the event

* place: Textual description of named geographic region near to the event. This may be a city name, or a Flinn-Engdahl Region name.

##### Conclusion

Historically, the state of Alaska and Hawaii are notably vulnerable to earthquakes due to their location (Pacific coast is under the Ring of Fire). In addition, the state of Nevada, California, Montana are the top 3 states where earthquakes occured most in the continental U.S. Therefore, out of 4 regions, the West experiences the most earthquakes not only the overall number but also ones greater than the magnitude of 2.0.

The Northeast region is regarded safe in terms of risky earthquakes.

It should be noted that the states on Rocky mountain and Appalachian mountain also undergo frequent earthquakes but most of them are minor incidents.

The state of Oklahoma is the exception of both case (located on neither Pacific nor major Mountain ranges). It may be the effect of Oklahoma Earthquake Swarms that show unique high Seismic events in central and north-central Oklahoma caused by hydraulic fracturing that is human-induced result.

Since this is the recent trend, we should keep an eye on this region as well as the state of Kansas and northern Texas.
